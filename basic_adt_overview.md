# Basic Abstract Data Types

Abstract Data Types (ADTs) are the structures in which we store and retrieve data. ADTs are not just focused on how the data will actually be stored in memory or implemented in code, but are more focused on how a programmer will interact with the information being stored.

ADTs have some basic structural properties. Some important ones are whether a structure is **linear** or **non-linear** and whether a structure is **mutable** or **immutable**. In a linear structure, the position of the data will be taken into account. There will be a first and a last item of data and every piece of data has a set position relative to the other pieces of data. For a description of non-linear structures, jump to [trees](trees_overview.md). Mutable structures can be altered and additions to the data set can be made. In an immutable structure, the data is set and cannot be changed dynamically.
