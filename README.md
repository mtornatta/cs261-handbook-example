# My Data Structures Handbook

#####by Michael Tornatta

##Introduction

The purpose of this handbook is to summarize what I have learned in cs261 and demonstrate a firm grasp of the data structures we've gone over. Computer science and all of the jobs requiring a base understanding of computer science basically focus on the organization and use of data. To accomplish this, we use data structures. This is why, as a computer science major who hopes to one day have a job in this industry, it is important to show a solid understanding of these concepts.
