# Built in Collections

Python has a number of built in **collections**. Collections are groups of data kept in a single structure. This data can be objects, strings, ints, and more. Python doesn't care if you mix your types so you can store anything you want in a collection.

Collections can be **ordered** or **unordered**, meaning that the collections structure either keeps track of what order the information was added or not. Collections can also be **mutable** or **immutable**, meaning that the information in the collection can be added and removed or not.
