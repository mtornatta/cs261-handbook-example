# Trees

Trees are non-linear structures which can be either **directed** or **undirected**. A directed tree is able to be traversed in a particular direction from node to node. An undirected tree is able to be traversed from one node to the next and then back without any limitations.

Trees have a wide variety of applications and are often times implemented through recursion. Objects or nodes in a tree contain references to "children" or nodes sitting on a level lower than itself. The nodes the children are under are called "parents". The base node in a tree is called the "root" and the nodes at the ends of the tree with no children are called "leaves".
